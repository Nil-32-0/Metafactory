Purifies blocks placed around it

<ins>Recipes</ins>
Takes blocks as an input and transforms them into other blocks.

No built-in method available, use custom recipe constructor from botaniaRecipes instead:
```
botaniaRecipes.pureDaisy(outputID, inputID)
```

Input can be either a block ID or a block tag.
