Recipe wrapper object contained in `naturesaura.js`
Offers (slightly) easier access to built-in methods for Nature's Aura recipes that can be called with 
`NaturesAuraRecipes.<recipe>`

To use, `NaturesAuraRecipes.initialize(event)` must be called before any other calls in order to allow the functions to work properly.
