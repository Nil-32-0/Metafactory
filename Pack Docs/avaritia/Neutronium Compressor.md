Takes a variable amount of items and some amount of time to produce up to one stack of output items.
Due to Extended Crafting being present, this machine will be deprecated and recipes should be done with the [[Quantum Compressor]].

```
event.recipes.avaritia.compressor(input, output, inputCount, time)
```

Built-in method can also be accessed with `avaritiaRecipes.compressor()`
