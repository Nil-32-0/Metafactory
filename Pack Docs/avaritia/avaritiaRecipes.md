Recipe wrapper object contained in avaritia.js
Implements various functions for Avaritia machines that can be called with 
`avaritiaRecipes.<recipe>`
Also offers (slightly) easier access to built-in methods.

To use, avaritiaRecipes.initialize(event) must be called before any other calls in order to allow the functions to work properly.
