Recipe wrapper object contained in `avaritia.js`
Offers (slightly) easier access to built-in methods for Avaritia machines that can be called with 
`avaritiaRecipes.<recipe>`

To use, `avaritiaRecipes.initialize(event)` must be called before any other calls in order to allow the functions to work properly.
